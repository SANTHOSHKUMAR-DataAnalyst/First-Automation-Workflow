# 🏦 Bank Loan Eligibility Automation – n8n Workflow

This is my first end-to-end **n8n automation workflow** that simplifies the **Bank loan application process** by checking eligibility and sending notifications using Gmail and Google Sheets.


### 🔗 Flow Description

1. **Form Submission**  
   The user submits a loan application form (e.g., via Typeform or Google Form).

2. **Google Sheets**  
   The submitted data is added to a Google Sheet for recordkeeping.

3. **Filter**  
   The applicant’s data is checked against eligibility conditions (e.g., salary, credit score, employment).

4. **Switch**  
   Based on the result:
   - Eligible candidates receive an **approval email**.
   - Ineligible ones get a **rejection email**.

5. **Manager Notification**  
   A final Gmail node sends a notification to the **bank manager** with the result.


## 💡 Why I Built This

I wanted to get hands-on with **n8n**, and decided to solve a real-world use case. Loan processing in banks involves multiple steps, and automating the eligibility and communication steps can save a lot of time.

This project gave me practical experience in:
- Connecting Google Sheets
- Using filters and conditional branching
- Sending dynamic emails via Gmail
- Visualizing real-time automation
